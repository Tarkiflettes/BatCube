# BatCube

A fast game where you are pursued by a ghost, you must escape level by finding buttons in sending waves of the good frequency (when there is a colored cylinder, there is a button / window with the same color in the room), Buttons will allow you to open door and escape level. You have a limit of wave to send, you can reload waves with blue plug. Two level are available for this game.
